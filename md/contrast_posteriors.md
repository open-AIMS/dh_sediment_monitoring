This plot features the posteriors predictions of each contrast
(baseline vs each subsequent year) marginalising over site for
VALUE_TYPE VAR within the ZONE Zone. Posteriors are presented on a
fold (fractional) scale. On a fold scale, a value of 2 indicates that
the estimated values in the focal year are twice those of the baseline
year. Inversely, a value of 0.5 indicates that the estimated values in
the focal year are half those of the baseline year. A value of 1
indicates no change. Note, the x-axis has log (base 2) spacing such
that the values of 2 and 0.5 are equidistant from 1.

Values greater than 1 indicate increases from baseline and values less
than one indicate declines. A dashed vertical line at 1 is included
for reference. The amount of evidence for an effect (change from
baseline) is empirically determined as the proportion of the posterior
distribution either less than (decline) or greater than (increase) 1.
