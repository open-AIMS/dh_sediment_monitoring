This page provides a way of fully exploring the un-modelled temporal
trends in both raw and standardised data for each Site, Measurement
Type and Variable.

Blue points represent the samples collected that are considered
"Baseline" or "Reference" samples from which subsequent samples at the
corresponding site are gauged. Red points represent non-"Baseline"
samples. Multiple panels (if present) distinguish standardised and
unstandardised data. Hovering over the points will reveal some of the
pertinent underlying data associated with the point.

Different combinations of Sites, Measurement Type and Variables can be
selected via their respective dropdown boxed in the panel above the
figures.
