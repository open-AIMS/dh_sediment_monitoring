This table summarises the comparisons between the average of the
baseline year(s) and each of the subsequent reporting years. Values
are reported on a **fold** (fractional) scale. On this scale, a value
of 1 indicates no change. Values of 0.5 and 2 would indicate that the
value in the reporting year is respectively half and twice that of the
baseline year(s).

Posteriors of the comparisons are summarised by their medians as well
as the lower and upper bounds of the 95% Highest Posterior Density
(HPD) interval. Also tabulated are the exceedence probabilities
associated with the probability that the values have declined since
the baseline year(s) (`Pl`) and the probabilities that they have
increased (`Pg`). These probabilities must sum to 1 and it is only
necessary to explore the larger value per comparison. As a guide
exeedence probabilities:

- **>0.95** provide strong evidence of an effect (change)
- **>0.9** provide evidence of an effect (change)
- **>0.85** provide week evidence of an effect (change)

Finally, there is also a column that represents the
polarity and evidence of change via a color.

- red: strong evidence of an increase
- orange: evidence of an increase
- yellow: weak evidence of an increase 
- white: no evidence of change
- light green: weak evidence of a decline
- mid green: evidence of a decline
- dark green: strong evidence of a decline
