The table presents a matrix in which:

- the columns represent the variables
- the rows represent the sites/zones/areas
- the colour of the cells represents the polarity and evidence of change:

    - red: strong evidence of an increase
    - orange: evidence of an increase
    - yellow: weak evidence of an increase 
    - white: no evidence of change
    - light green: weak evidence of a decline
    - mid green: evidence of a decline
    - dark green: strong evidence of a decline
    - gray: model not completed (typically due to a lack of data)

- models built on data that includes values below limit of
  reporting/detection are marked with a black flag (<span class="far
  fa-flag"></span>)

The selectors can be used to filter what subset of data are presented
in the table:

- scale of aggregation (site/zone/area)
- whether or not the data are standardised
- the type of variable (metals, hydrocarbons or both)
- the focal year to compare to the baseline (2019/2020)
