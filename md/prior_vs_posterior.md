Plots of priors (black points and whiskers) and posteriors (coloured
points and whiskers) for each of the main model parameters. This sort
of figure provides a way to visualy assess how **informative** the
priors are likely to be in determining the posteriors. Ideally, we
want the priors to only be **weakly** informative. That is, we only
want them to have a regularising influence (encouraging the sampler to
stay within a range of parameter estimates that are vaguely
plausible). Hence, the ideal is for the priors (black) to be either
substantially wider (longer in the figure) or centered at a different
location (position along y-axis) than the corresponding posteriors
(coloured).
