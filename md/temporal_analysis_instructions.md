At the top of this page there is a collapsed box containing an
overview of the model validation checks. To view the table, ensure
that the box is expanded (click on the "-" icon in the upper right
corner of the box banner).

The table is filterable (by entering text in the text boxes between
the column headings and first row of data). Each row represents the
inforation about a single model. The validity tests represent whether
there is any evidence to reject (p-value < 0.05). A value of "fail"
indicates that there is evidence that the test revealed evidence to
invalidate the assumption:

- **ks** the KS (uniformity test)
- **ds.p** the dispersion test
- **q** residual plot quantiles
- **o** outlier observations
- **valid** whether any of the above failed

The table is initially sorted such models flagged as potentially
invalid are towards the top.

The page also displays diagnostics and summaries of each of the fitted
models accessible via hierarchical tabs and selectable via Zone,
Variable and Standardisation selection boxes.

More information about each of the validation and summarisations are
provided inside the corresponding set of tabs.
