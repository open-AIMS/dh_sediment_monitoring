MCMC traceplots are visual tools used to assess the convergence and
mixing behavior of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms in
Bayesian statistics. They offer valuable insights into the efficiency
and reliability of your MCMC analysis.

**What do they show?**

Each trace plot displays the values of a specific parameter estimated
by the MCMC algorithm across all iterations. Multiple parameters can
be plotted individually or jointly to compare their behavior. 

**How to interpret them:**

- **Convergence:**

    A well-converged chain should exhibit stability over iterations,
    meaning the trace plot plateaus around a constant value or
    fluctuates within a predictable range. Trends or drifts indicate
    the chain hasn't converged, and the estimates might be biased.
    
- **Mixing:**

    Good mixing implies the chain explores the parameter space
    efficiently, visiting different possible values frequently. Stuck
    chains remain in specific regions, leading to poor exploration and
    unreliable estimates. 
    
- **Autocorrelation:**

    If consecutive values in the trace plot are highly correlated, the
    chain mixes slowly, impacting efficiency. 
    
- **Mixing across chains:**

    Running multiple chains (starting from different points) should
    converge to similar values, supporting mixing and reliability.

**Interpretation tips:**

- Consider the expected behavior of your model: some parameters might
  naturally fluctuate more than others.
- Use reference values or theoretical limits to judge if the parameter
  values seem reasonable.
- Combine trace plots with other diagnostics like Gelman-Rubin
  convergence measures for a comprehensive assessment.
