The multi-panel figure displayed on this page partitions the data into
Zone/Measurement types (via left hand selectors) and figure columns
(measures). The x-axis (rows) of the figure represents the sampling
years and the y-axis represents the individual sampling sites. Blue
points represent the samples collected that are considered to be
"Baseline" or "Reference" samples from which subsequent samples at the
corresponding site are to be gauged (compared). Red points represent
non-"Baseline" samples.
