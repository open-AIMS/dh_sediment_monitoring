Posterior probability density overlay plots display the density
distribution of the observed data (dark line) overlayed upon the
density distributions of a large number of posterior predictions
(fainter blue lines).

The general idea is that if a model is to be useful, it should be able
to generate observations (predictions) that approximate the data used
to train the model in the first place. If this is not the case, then
it is likely that the model does not adequately capture the pertinent
properties of the observed data.

Ideally, the densities of the numerous realisations from the
posteriors should match closely the density of the original observed
data. The manner by which the densities differ from that of the
original data can be used to infer what aspects of the data the model
is under or over estimating and adjustments can be made to the model
accordingly.
