The modelled (predicted) values of a focal variable are displayed in
tabular and graphical form.

In the table, each row represents the summaries of predictions for a
specific year. The summaries are in the form of median as well as
lower and upper 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals of the
full model posteriors. Years in which data included values below the
limit of reporting are marked by a black flag (<span class="far
fa-flag"></span>). The table also indicates which years are considered
Baseline.

These same summaries are also presented graphically in the figure.
Additionally, the figure displays the underlying un-modelled data in
gray.  Individual sites are connected by gray lines.
