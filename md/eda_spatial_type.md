This page provides a way to visualise the spatial distribution of
un-modelled data on a map. It also provides a representation of the
temporal trends in the data. The subset of data presented in the
temporal graph and on the map are controlled by a set of dropdown
selector boxes. The data presented on the map are also further refined
to a single year and that is controlled by the slider situated above
the temporal figure.

In the temporal figure, each point represents an individual
observation and observations collected from the same sites over time
are connected by gray lines. Blue points represent the samples
collected that are considered "Baseline" or "Reference" samples from
which subsequent samples at the corresponding site are gauged. Red
points represent non-"Baseline" samples. Multiple panels (if present)
distinguish standardised and unstandardised data. Hovering over the
points will reveal some of the pertinent underlying data associated
with the point.

Sites are represented on the map by circular points, the colour of
which are mapped to a scale proportional to the data values. Panning
and zooming of the map is done via the mouse (moving while left mouse
press: panning, scrolling of mouse button: zooming). The Zone selector
dropdown controls which Harbour Zone(s) are highlighted and populated
with data.
