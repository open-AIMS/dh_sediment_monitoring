This page displays a multi-panel figure depicting the temporal
sampling design of the data within each of the Harbour Zones. The
y-axis (rows) of the figure represents the Sampling sites (based on
the Site names they were first assigned). Blue points represent the
samples collected that are considered to be "Baseline" or "Reference"
samples from which subsequent samples at the corresponding site are to
be gauged (compared). Red points represent non-"Baseline" samples.
Points are jointed by lines to help identify discontinued sampling
(where no line exists) and where no Baselines have been defined (when
the left point of a sequence is red).

To keep the figure to a manageable size and degree of clutter, the
figure fucusses only on "Sites" that were first monitored in the
semester indicated by the dark blue selector to the left side of the
figure. The selectors are partitioned into 6 monthly (a semester)
chunks and clicking on a different selector will update the figure to
a different fraction of the data.
