The coefficients (parameter estimates) table displays each of the main
model parameter estimates on the scale of the link function.
Parameters that start with `b_` are the population-level (fixed)
effects. Parameters that start with `sd_` are the varying (random)
effects.

The table lists the posterior median as well as lower and upper bounds
of the 95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval for each
parameter. Also tabulated are the total number of posterior draws
(`length`), Rhat values (`rhat`), and effective sample size in both
the bulk of the posterior (`ess_bulk`) and tail of the posterior
(`ess_tail`).
